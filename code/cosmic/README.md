# Cosmic sub-directory.

This repo contains scritps and jupyter-notebooks for our testing of using **COSMIC** to simulate and evolve populations of binary stars for each cluster in our database. It is recommended to use the getClusterBinaries script located in this directory and copied in the code parent directory. In order to run the code properly, cosmic must be installed and use din an environment. Directions to this can be found on [**COSMIC's** documentation](https://cosmic-popsynth.github.io).
