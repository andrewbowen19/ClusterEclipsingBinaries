#Cluster Compile sub-directory

Contained in this directory is the code to compile our OC and GC cluster data into one standardized source.
These files, as mentioned above, are available to download [here](https://northwestern.box.com/s/6iq63teq6uwrwasmclubt1tsp4f8cquf). However, it is recommended to simply use the compiled data files, available at [this link](https://northwestern.box.com/s/ed31vf5bswf6e84669qdk625gjk6k0jw).
