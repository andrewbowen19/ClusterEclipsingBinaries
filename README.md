# Welcome to the GitHub repository of our Cluster Eclipsing Binaries project!

This project, serving as my senior thesis, studies the period recovery of the new Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
for eclipsing binary stars in clusters. By learning about the periods of binary stars, we can then infer the mass of these stars -- allowing us to test our models of stellar evolution.

We used data from catalogs provided from several sources of both [Open](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=webda+catalog&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) and [Globular clusters](http://physwww.mcmaster.ca/~harris/mwgc.dat). 

Our project attempts to optimize the LSST cadence for viewing eclipsing binaries between different LSST observing strategies (*baseline* and *colossus*, respectively). In general, *colossus* will observe the regions of the sky near the galactic plane more frequently than *baseline*. The thinking being that with more observations of regions where globular and open clusters reside, there is a higher chance of successfully recovering the period of eclipsing binaries in those clusters.

Feel free to look over our ![**project poster**](./poster/AAS/AAS-poster-final.pdf) which recently was awarded as a Chambliss Medalist at the 235th Meeting of the American AStronoimcal Society!

The thesis write-up of this project is coming soon!
