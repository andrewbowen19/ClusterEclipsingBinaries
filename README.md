Working Git repository for our cluster eclipsing binary project (made on 7/8/19)

Want to include eclipsing binaries in star clusters (both open and globular clusters) in our EBLSST project
Also want to include cluster sigma read-ins within our class

Will try to integrate our code versions and run them on Quest


7/15/19 Update:

Have cleaned Cluster data file (one file for both OCs and GCs), now we want to integrate that with our getClusterBinaries class and be able to run them through cosmic, then we will post on Quest and run everything together for 40k binaries per cluster


Successfully drew sigma for every cluster (get_sigma fucntion in cluster_muster) - now we want to run getClusterbinaries on every cluster and then use EBLSST

Need paper write-up by friday, poster by August 8th for LSST conference
