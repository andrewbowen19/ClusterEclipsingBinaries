This part of our repo is dedicated to the writing of my thesis.

The requisite .tex files are located in the **thesis** directory as well as additional auxillary files to compile the latex script.
Requisite figures should reside in the **figures** sub-directory and can be downloaded [at this link](https://northwestern.box.com/s/v9j0x3sw29gd6myqchcrgzrvotm8ltgb). The figures directory and corresponding folder on box have the requisite structure for the latex script to compile.
The final draft of our thesis in .pdf form can be viewed ![here.](/thesis/AndrewBowenThesis.pdf)

Currently under preparation is a Research Note for the American astronomical Society-style writing sample to be published in the [Northwestern Undergraduate Research Journal](https://thenurj.com). In addition, a larger paper is also in preparation for publication later in 2020/early 2021. Be sure to check back soon for more updates!
