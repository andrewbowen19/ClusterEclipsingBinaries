# CEB Poster

This subdirectory houses the requisite files for presentation posters created for our project.

We presented [this poster](https://northwestern.box.com/s/cq45xp9tnakybd7ze35qfrhhqrsga03d) at the 2019 LSSTC Project Community Workshop in Tuscon, AZ.

In addition, we used a similar design structure to present [a new and improved version](https://northwestern.box.com/s/hxuq4fsl76aaxg3m4ctazmjnv6ru56jh) at the 235th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Honolulu, HI. As of April 2020, we're very pleased to say that this poster was named a [Chambliss medalist](https://aas.org/grants-and-prizes/chambliss-astronomy-achievement-student-awards) for an undergraduate poster.
