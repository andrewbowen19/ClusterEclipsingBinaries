# Quest binary plotting repository (old)

This repository incudes the analyse scripts for each observing scenario
The scripts in this repository will run if posted on Northwestern's HPC Quest, where the requisite data files reside. However, it is recommended to use the more flexible analyse scripts included in the '*flex*' sub-driectory. Those scripts will produce plots/outputs without having to be run separately for each observing scenario.

The file tree structure of this directory is also not the same as that of the flex directory, with crowding and colossus scenarios on different levels of the file tree

Just make your life easier, use the analyse scripts in '*flex*'.
