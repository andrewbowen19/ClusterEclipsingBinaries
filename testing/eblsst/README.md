Playground to manipulate eblsst output files from analyse scripts, can generate histograms easily for each scenario

In order to create histograms for different binary parameters in each observing scenario, run eblsstPlotter via command line
The file tree loop included containing the cluster EBLSST files is under the 'clusters' subdirectory
