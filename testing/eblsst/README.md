Playground to manipulate eblsst output files from analyse scripts, can generate histograms easily for each scenario

May want to create filter histograms to compare across different observing scenarios

In order to create histograms for different binary parameters in each observing scenario, run runPlotter via command line
The file tree loops through the EBLSST files in the 'clusters' subdirectory. 

The histogram plots generated by these scripts can be downloaded via Box [at this link.](https://northwestern.box.com/s/q5hktnxzxyzmx44r9u0r3tmmiba3uql8)
