# AnalyseClusterLISA output file Analysis

Playground to manipulate eblsst output files from analyse scripts, can generate histograms easily for each scenario

May want to create filter histograms to compare across different observing scenarios

In order to create histograms for different binary parameters in each observing scenario, run *runPlotter* via command line
The file tree loops through the EBLSST files in the 'clusters' subdirectory. It generates an eblsstPlotter object for each observing scenario and creates the desired plots.

The histogram plots generated by these scripts can be downloaded via Box [at this link.](https://northwestern.box.com/s/q5hktnxzxyzmx44r9u0r3tmmiba3uql8)

In addition, you can now make CDF histograms with the *makeCDF* method included in the eblsstPlotter class. These are saved in the CDF subdirectories in the observing-scenario specific 'combined' directory (check Box). These CDFs plot the cumulative density, so it shows the fraction of binaries recovered at each x-axis value.
