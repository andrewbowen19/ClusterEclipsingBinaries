### LISA WD-Binary data files ###

The .csv files in this directory are from our Quest runs of the lisaRunAnalyse script

These contain WD Binaries that are observable by LSST and detectable by LISA.
Many of these are empty .csv files because period recovery of a WD binary system is difficult for LSST.

These files are copied from Quest in our testing/flex subdirectory
