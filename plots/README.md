# Plots directory

This sub-directory contains copied plots produced from our python scripts.

In general, python scripts output and save plots to the *plots* folder located in their working directory. After they are saved in the working directory they can be copied into this directory.

Plots from our project are housed in [this box folder](https://northwestern.box.com/s/ilwzu9esd37rq9vg6ri169htg8apu63d) and are freely available for download. Due to our gitignore configuration, pdf versions of the plots are not posted to GitHub, but are available at the box link above. This is due to GitHub's file size limits and memory saving efforts.
